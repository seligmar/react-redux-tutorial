React Redux is useful for managing state especially in large apps with lots of components- data in react only flows in one direction, but redux makes it possiple to access data across the app without having to store all data/state in the highest component. State is stored seperately in the store and data can be accessed exactly where it is needed- no more need for prop drilling.
